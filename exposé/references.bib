  abstract = {Off-chaining has been suggested to enhance scalablity and privacy
              of blockchains, especially in public networks. However, a
              systematic classification is missing. In this paper, we propose
              generic off-chaining models categorizing different types of
              off-chaining. From our analysis of these models, we conclude that
              off-chain computations are particularly powerful and subsequently
              provide a description and comparison of off-chain computation
              approaches.},

  ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force with
              the potential to disrupt traditional industries by providing
              decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. However, blockchain
              systems face a fundamental challenge known as the Blockchain
              Trilemma, which posits that a blockchain cannot simultaneously
              achieve optimal levels of decentralization, security, and
              scalability. This paper addresses the Blockchain Trilemma through
              rigorous mathematical proof, demonstrating that achieving maximum
              levels of all three properties concurrently leads to inherent
              contradictions. By formalizing the definitions of decentralization,
              security, and scalability, we provide a foundational framework to
              understand these trade-offs. Our analysis includes a proof by
              contradiction and computational complexity analysis. This work aims
              to deepen the understanding of the fundamental limitations of
              blockchain technology, offering insights for future innovations and
              helping navigate the inevitable trade-offs.},
